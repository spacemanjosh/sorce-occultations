# SORCE SOLSTICE Occultations group

This project is an ongoing effor to understand the Earth's atmosphere in the 200km to 300km altitude range by utilizing solar and stellar occultations as measured by the SORCE SOLSTICE spacecraft.

## REU 2021 project: Atmospheric Scale-Height via Solar Occultations measured by SORCE

Solar occultations provide a glimpse into the vertical structure of the atmosphere by inferring atmospheric properties from the extinction of Sunlight as it passes through the atmosphere.  The goal of this project is to analyze solar occultation data in order to derive scale heights for various atmospheric species.  The data that we will use was collected over 17 years by the XUV Photometer System (XPS) and SOLar STellar Irradiance Comparison Experiment (SOLSTICE) instruments that flew and operated aboard the Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) spacecraft.  On each orbit, as the spacecraft emerged from eclipse, Sun light is occulted by the Earth’s atmosphere allowing for atmospheric density profiles to be measured.

This project will analyze data from the Lyman-alpha channel of the SORCE XPS instrument and to plot occultation profiles of the Earth’s atmosphere in order to examine and understand the scale heights of atmospheric species.  We will also compare these occultations to similar measurements from the SORCE SOSLTICE instrument which has a much higher spectral resolution.  This project has the added potential to provide an understanding of the atmospheric attenuation of the Solar Spectral Irradiance (SSI) as a function of solar cycle variability. 


## REU 2022 project: Atmospheric Scale Height and Molecular Oxygen Density via Stellar Occultations Measured by SORCE

The thermosphere is the uppermost layer of the atmosphere, beginning at about 100 kilometers and ending at about 600 kilometers. At about 100 kilometers, molecular oxygen  〖(O〗_2) begins to break down into oxygen. We used stellar occultation scans collected from the Solar Stellar Irradiance Comparison Experiment (SOLSTICE) instrument, on the Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) satellite to look at the scale- height and density of molecular oxygen in this region. These stellar occultations measure the irradiance of a star as it passes through the middle and lower part of the Earth’s thermosphere, from about 300km to about 20km, at a wavelength of about 140 nm in the far UV range. 
The measurements taken by SOLSTICE included both solar and stellar occultation scans. The stellar occultation scans were taken as a calibration of SORCE and thus span a greater time period, and there are many more. Irradiance values taken were in the wavelength range of 138.01 nm to 139.33 nm, molecular oxygen absorbs these wavelengths. SOLSTICE took 818 stellar occultation scans over a seven year period between October 2003, and October 2010, which is a good portion of the solar cycle and includes a solar minimum. We present the density of molecular oxygen in the middle and lower thermosphere and show its variability over the solar cycle. 

## REU 2023 project: Gravity Waves via Stellar Occultations Measured by SORCE SOLSTICE

Stellar occultations provide a glimpse into the vertical structure of the atmosphere by inferring atmospheric properties from the extinction of star light as it passes through the atmosphere.  The data that we will use was collected by the SOLar STellar Irradiance Comparison Experiment (SOLSTICE) instrument that flew and operated aboard the Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) spacecraft.
 
This project will build on previous work using SORCE SOLSTICE stellar occultations. The student will develop Python code to analyze these occultation profiles to examine vertical oscillations in the atmosphere known as gravity waves in the altitude range of 100 to 200 km. Gravity wave measurements over this altitude range are rare, and their behavior is poorly understood. The student will catalog the gravity wave wavelength with altitude, local time and latitude, and look for trends. Additional analysis, as time permits, will include calculating the gravity wave potential energy density and its variation with altitude.
